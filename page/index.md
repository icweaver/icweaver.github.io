## [WASP-50b (Weaver et al. submitted)](https://icweaver.github.io/WASP-50b/)
\begin{center}
  \figure{
    path = "/assets/nice_image.jpg",
    caption = "We present a new <b>ground-based visual transmission spectrum</b> of the hot Jupiter WASP-43b, obtained
    as part of <b>ACCESS</b>. We collected four transits observed between 2015 and 2018, with a combined wavelength
    coverage between 5300 and 9000 Å and an average photometric precision of 708 ppm in 230 Å bins. We perform an
    <b>atmospheric retrieval</b> of our transmission spectrum combined with literature Hubble Space Telescope/WFC3
    observations to search for the presence of clouds/hazes as well as Na, K, Hα, and H₂O planetary absorption and
    stellar spot contamination. <b>We do not detect a statistically significant presence of Na I or K I alkali lines, or
    Hα in the atmosphere of WASP-43b</b>. We find that the observed transmission spectrum can be best explained by a
    combination of heterogeneities on the photosphere of the host star and a <b>clear planetary</b> atmosphere with
    water."

## [HAT-P-23b (Weaver et al. 2021)](https://icweaver.github.io/HAT-P-23b/README.html)
\begin{center}
  \figure{
    path = "/assets/nice_image.jpg",
    caption = "We present a new <b>ground-based visible transmission spectrum</b> of the <b>high-gravity, hot
    Jupiter</b> HAT-P-23b, obtained as part of the <b>ACCESS</b> project. We derive the spectrum from five transits
    observed between 2016 and 2018, with combined wavelength coverage between 5200 Å - 9269 Å in 200 Å bins, and with a
    median precision of 247 ppm per bin. HAT-P-23b's relatively high surface gravity (g ~ 30 m/s²), combined with
    updated stellar and planetary parameters from Gaia DR2, gives a 5-scale-height signal of 384 ppm for a
    hydrogen-dominated atmosphere. Bayesian models favor a <b>clear atmosphere for the planet with the tentative
    presence of TiO</b>, after simultaneously modeling stellar contamination, using spots parameter constraints from
    photometry. <b>If confirmed, HAT-P-23b would be the first example of a high-gravity gas giant with a clear
    atmosphere observed in transmission at optical/NIR wavelengths</b>; therefore, we recommend expanding observations
    to the UV and IR to confirm our results and further characterize this planet. This result demonstrates how combining
    transmission spectroscopy of exoplanet atmospheres with long-term photometric monitoring of the host stars can help
    disentangle the exoplanet and <b>stellar activity signals</b>."
