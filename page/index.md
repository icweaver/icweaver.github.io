    caption = "We present a new <b>ground-based visible transmission spectrum</b> of the <b>high-gravity, hot
    Jupiter</b> HAT-P-23b, obtained as part of the <b>ACCESS</b> project. We derive the spectrum from five transits
    observed between 2016 and 2018, with combined wavelength coverage between 5200 √Ö - 9269 √Ö in 200 √Ö bins, and with a
    median precision of 247 ppm per bin. HAT-P-23b's relatively high surface gravity (g ~ 30 m/s¬≤), combined with
    updated stellar and planetary parameters from Gaia DR2, gives a 5-scale-height signal of 384 ppm for a
    hydrogen-dominated atmosphere. Bayesian models favor a <b>clear atmosphere for the planet with the tentative
    presence of TiO</b>, after simultaneously modeling stellar contamination, using spots parameter constraints from
    photometry. <b>If confirmed, HAT-P-23b would be the first example of a high-gravity gas giant with a clear
    atmosphere observed in transmission at optical/NIR wavelengths</b>; therefore, we recommend expanding observations
    to the UV and IR to confirm our results and further characterize this planet. This result demonstrates how combining
    transmission spectroscopy of exoplanet atmospheres with long-term photometric monitoring of the host stars can help
    disentangle the exoplanet and <b>stellar activity signals</b>."
