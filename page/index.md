## [WASP-50b (Weaver et al. submitted)](https://icweaver.github.io/WASP-50b/)
\begin{center}
  \figure{
    path = "/assets/nice_image.jpg",
    caption = "We present a new **ground-based visual transmission spectrum** of the hot Jupiter WASP-43b, obtained as
    part of *ACCESS*. We collected four transits observed between 2015 and 2018, with a combined wavelength coverage
    between 5300 and 9000 Å and an average photometric precision of 708 ppm in 230 Å bins. We perform an **atmospheric
    retrieval** of our transmission spectrum combined with literature Hubble Space Telescope/WFC3 observations to search
    for the presence of clouds/hazes as well as Na, K, Hα, and H2O planetary absorption and stellar spot contamination.
    **We do not detect a statistically significant presence of Na I or K I alkali lines, or Hα in the atmosphere of
    WASP-43b**. We find that the observed transmission spectrum can be best explained by a combination of
    heterogeneities on the photosphere of the host star and a **clear planetary** atmosphere with water."

## [HAT-P-23b (Weaver et al. 2021)](https://icweaver.github.io/HAT-P-23b/README.html)
\begin{center}
  \figure{
    path = "/assets/nice_image.jpg",
    caption = "We present a new **ground-based visible transmission spectrum** of the **high-gravity, hot Jupiter**
    HAT-P-23b, obtained as part of the **ACCESS** project. We derive the spectrum from five transits observed between
    2016 and 2018, with combined wavelength coverage between 5200 Å - 9269 Å in 200 Å bins, and with a median precision
    of 247 ppm per bin. HAT-P-23b's relatively high surface gravity (g ~ 30 m/s²), combined with updated stellar and
    planetary parameters from Gaia DR2, gives a 5-scale-height signal of 384 ppm for a hydrogen-dominated atmosphere.
    Bayesian models favor a **clear atmosphere for the planet with the tentative presence of TiO**, after simultaneously
    modeling stellar contamination, using spots parameter constraints from photometry. *If confirmed, HAT-P-23b would be
    the first example of a high-gravity gas giant with a clear atmosphere observed in transmission at optical/NIR
    wavelengths*; therefore, we recommend expanding observations to the UV and IR to confirm our results and further
    characterize this planet. This result demonstrates how combining transmission spectroscopy of exoplanet atmospheres
    with long-term photometric monitoring of the host stars can help disentangle the exoplanet and *stellar activity
    signals*."
