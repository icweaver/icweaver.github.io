									     I am a fourth year graduate student in Harvard University's Astronomy and Astrophysics department working with
                       Mercedes L&oacutepez-Morales on exoplanet atmosphere characterization. When not lurking

                <h3 align="left"> Particle Trajectory Code </h3>
								<ul class="features">
									<li>
                    <span class="image"><img src="images/sho_no_energy_loss.gif" alt="" /></span>
										<h3>Zero Energy Loss</h3>
										<p align="justify">This is an ideal particle trajectory calculated according to the binary system's Roche
                    Potential. The solution was
                    iterated with an RK4 integrator. The initial conditions were set with a thermal velocity
                    at L1, angled towards the accretor (in orange) with an angle determined by the system's
                    mass ratio (see equation 24 of Lubow and Shu 1974).</p>
									</li>
									<li>
                    <span class="image"><img src="images/sho_inertial_3D.gif" alt="" /></span>
										<h3>Artificial Energy Loss</h3>
                    <p align="justify"> Here is the same setup, but with artificial energy loss every time step. This was done to mimic the
                    energy that is lost to shocks and other collisions in real fluid interactions. This was done by having
                    the test particle lose energy while maintaining its angular momentum. I also added a
                    little kick in the z component of the particle's initial velocity to make it a little more
                    fun to watch.</p>
									</li>
									<li>
                    <span class="image"><img src="images/xy.png" alt="" /></span>
										<h3>WASP-12/b System</h3>
										<p align="justify">This is a top down plot of the same code applied to WASP-12/b (to scale). I waited until a full
                    orbit to turn on the artificial energy loss to mimic on full lap of the accretion stream
                    before colliding with itself. The corners due to the Coriolis force are clearly scene and
                    the orbit settles down into its circularization radius (in green), as predicted from angular momentum
                    conservation.</p>
									</li>

                <h3 align="left"> FLASH </h3>

                    </div>
										<h3>Sedov Test Case</h3>
										<p align="justify"> Example test case of evolving Sedov explosions in FLASH. I added two,
                    then three, explosions to visualize how the code handles shocks and reflection boundary
                    conditions. An interesting thing to note is that vorticity is conserved; there are as many
                    counter-clockwise vortices as clockwise ones at all times.</p>
									</li>
									<li>
                    <div class="video-wrapper">

                    </div>
										<h3>WASP-12/b 2D</h3>
										<p align="justify"> This code was then applied to WASP-12/b in a 2D setup. Essential, the
                    massless test particle in the ballistic particle code was replaced with a fluid outflow
                    boundary with properties adopted from Lai et al 2010. I then added an artificial ramp up
                    in density at around the 5 day mark to effectively fast-forward the disk to a more evolved
                    state.</p>

										<h3>WASP-12/b 3D</h3>
										<p align="justify">The same FLASH simulation was adapted to 3D to create the image above.
                    This is an isodensity contour plot taken part way through the simulation. The location of
                    L1 can be seen as the orange-yellow sphere towards the bottom left. These simulations were
                    used to create virtual light curves to compare with observations from HST's Cosmic Origins Spectrograph.</p>

									<h2>Outreach</h2>
                  <h3 align="left">GSAS-OLAH</h3>
									<div align="justify">GSAS Open Labs At Harvard (GSAS-OLAH) is a graduate student group
                    recently founded at Harvard by <a style="color:blue;" target="_blank"
                      href="http://astronomy.fas.harvard.edu/people/munazza-alam">Munazza Alam</a> and myself. The group simultaneously
                    develops communication and organization skills, and serves the community through
                    scientific outreach for the graduate students involved. These goals will primarily be
                    accomplished through quarterly Science Café events to be held at the Harvard Science
                    Center. These events will allow graduate students in GSAS from a wide range of STEAM
                    disciplines to share their current research through short TED-like talks aimed at middle
                    through high school students in the Boston area. The audience will have the opportunity to
                    speak with the graduate student presenters on a more individualized basis after the talks
                    to learn about their perspective going through school and becoming involved in cutting
                    edge research. These talks will be tailored for students at a crucial time in the
                    development of their empirical and critical thinking skills and the presentations
                    themselves will serve as indispensable professional development for the graduate students
                    as they prepare for a career in academia or industry. </div>
