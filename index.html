            <h1>Ian C. Weaver, Ph.D.</h1>
            <p>Howdy, I'm Ian.</p>
            <p>I did my PhD at the Center for Astrophysics | Harvard &amp; Smithsonian studying the atmospheres of large exoplanets and writing software to help analyze them. I had the opportunity to work on all stages of the process, including observing with large ground-based observatories, extracting and reducing time series of raw spectral data, detrending of potential signals via different Gaussian Process (GP) and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) techniques, and model fitting with a range of statistical Bayesian inference frameworks including Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) and nested sampling to study the atmospheres of these other worlds.</p>
            <p>I currently serve as an education and outreach astronomer for the Carl Sagan Center for Research at SETI. In my free time, I like to row on Lake Merritt, help maintain JuliaAstro and other open source projects, and help run Onaketa: an education non-profit dedicated to supporting Black and Brown youth in STEM.</p>

            <p>We present a new ground-based visual transmission spectrum of the hot Jupiter WASP-43b, obtained as part of ACCESS. We collected four transits observed between 2015 and 2018, with a combined wavelength coverage between 5300 and 9000 √Ö and an average photometric precision of 708 ppm in 230 √Ö bins. We perform an atmospheric retrieval of our transmission spectrum combined with literature Hubble Space Telescope/WFC3 observations to search for the presence of clouds/hazes as well as Na, K, HŒ±, and H‚ÇÇO planetary absorption and stellar spot contamination. We do not detect a statistically significant presence of Na I or K I alkali lines, or HŒ± in the atmosphere of WASP-43b. We find that the observed transmission spectrum can be best explained by a combination of heterogeneities on the photosphere of the host star and a clear planetary atmosphere with water.</p>
